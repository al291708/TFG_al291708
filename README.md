# Neural-Networks-Applied-To-A-Tower-Defense-Videogame
Final Degree Project. Unity, Tensorflow, Tower Defense Videogame

The proposed Final Degree Project consists in the development of a video game of the Tower Defense genre in the Unity3D engine that incorporates a NPC that uses machine learning techniques to simulate the behavior of a human player and adapt it to the different
situations of inside a game. This NPC will improve its skills based on previous game experiences by using neural networks.

The main objective is to develop an artificial intelligence for a video game by using neural networks. This neural network should give us the best action given a game status. This is how the NPC will be able to adapt its actions to the changing situations during a game. It will have to learn both from its experience in previous games against another NPC and its current games against human players.

The folder "./ml-agents-master" includes all the required files for using ML Agents. Same data structure has been mantained to avoid conflicts with this ML Agents plugin. The Unity project is in the "./ml-agents-master/unity-environment" folder.

Software needed:
Unity3D, Tensorflow, Python, CUDA, TensorflowSharp. Information about installation in https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents
